/** 
    The Maply Linear Texture Builder is used to construct linear textures
    for use on widened vectors.
    
    Linear textures of this type are used to represent dotted and dashed lines.  These may come from Mapnik configuration files or you can just make them up yourself.
    
    After creating an image with this object, you'll want to pass it as a parameter to the widened vector add method.
